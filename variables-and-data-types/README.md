This program is just basic program that shows how to declare variables and declare data types in Fortran with some other minor things like using huge() and tiny() on data types to see their largest and smallest values. It also includes some more advanced print statements than previously used that formats the print statement a little (for example: print "(a4, i1)", "Int ", kind(i_num1))

## Compile Instructions
